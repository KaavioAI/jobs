# Open Roles at Kaavio

## Product Engineer

### About Kaavio

[Kaavio](https://www.kaavio.ai) builds AI-powered tools that help people buy and sell complex physical products. We work with industrial and science distributors who manage massive catalogs of technical products â€“ think millions of SKUs, each with detailed specs and documentation. With our tools plumbing, life sciences, HVAC, and industrial distributors extract images, descriptions and structured data for 10k+ products in days instead of months. 

This is an enormous and growing opportunity. Factories, labs, and job sites will spend $8.5T online by 2030 â€“ B2B ecommerce is 5x the size of consumer and growing twice as fast. At the same time, 83% of B2B sellers say their product data is incomplete, inconsistent, or outdated. 

Kaavio was founded by a CEO with prior founder experience and deep expertise in technical sales, together with a CTO who has spent years building and leading engineering teams at startups. Both have been early employees at multiple successful startups and bring strong product focus.

### How we work

* **Start with the customer:** we build for real problems and we learn those from customer conversations.  

* **Learn by doing, not debating:** itâ€™s better to write some code, ship an experience, or talk to some customers and then make a decision instead of debating hypotheticals and letting the loudest person win  

* **Everybody codes & everybody talks to customers:** this doesnâ€™t mean everyone is an engineer or a sales exec. It does mean anyone can push a CSS fix or write a SQL query to answer analytics questions. And everyone gets on customer calls to explain the product, give demos, plus ask and answer questions.   

* **Default to sharing:** to enable autonomy and accountability, everyone needs context. So we default to sharing everything openly. We share draft PRs, planning docs, company plans, board meeting notes, and company finances.   

* **Celebrate wins:** big and small, we keep each other going by recognizing progress, including the mistakes we learned from. 

### Who weâ€™re looking for

* **Problem owners:** We need people who can take a problem and make it theirs all the way through. We expect everyone at Kaavio to proactively try things, learn quickly, and know when to pull in help. Progress matters more than perfection.

* **Resilient problem solvers:** A startup is challenging: there are more good ideas than time in the week, customers workflows are messy, complexity abounds. The right mindset is to collaborate, iterate, and keep moving forward.

* **Collaborative professionals:** Weâ€™re building a welcoming environment where excellent humans can do their best work. This means being thoughtful, flexible, and respectful.

* **Genuine builders:** Weâ€™re a team who love making things. Whether itâ€™s software or not, let us know what youâ€™ve been working on. 

### What youâ€™ll be doing

* **Owning features end-to-end:** Youâ€™ll fully own features: shaping ideas, talking with users, aligning with company goals. This means youâ€™ll build MVPs, testing them in production with real users, iterate on feedback, and ensure your work has lasting impact.

* **Building with good judgment:** Youâ€™ll ship full-stack features that include thoughtful UX by default. When something needs more polish or deeper design exploration, youâ€™ll collaborate with designâ€”but the foundation is yours to own.

* **Implementing AI-powered features:** Large language models are central to what we do. We donâ€™t expect you to have a PhD in AI, but we do expect you to explore how LLMs reshape the way we build applications today. Youâ€™ll work on improving recommendations, fine-tuning prompts, and evaluating outputs so customers get clear, trustworthy results.

* **Talking with users:** Feedback loops matter. Youâ€™ll not just read user feedback but build relationshipsâ€”bouncing ideas off them, sharing new features early, and shipping in close partnership.

* **Supporting customers:** Everyone rotates into support. Investigating issues, shipping fixes, and talking directly to customers is one of the fastest ways to learn and to make our product better. Some on-call time is part of the role.

* **Writing docs:** Clear docs are part of good engineering. Youâ€™ll draft the first version for the things you build, and collaborate with others to refine them so the whole team (and our users) can benefit from the knowledge.

### Requirements

* Experience with TypeScript, React, and Postgres (or similar technologies)
* Comfort operating in ambiguity and taking initiative without perfect specs
* Experience bringing a project from 0 to 1 (a side-project you launched, a company you founded, or a project you led)
* Strong writing skills: you should be able to communicate clearly, concisely, and persuasively in writing
* Applicants must be legally authorized to work in the US. We are unable to provide sponsorship for this role. 

### Nice to have

* Experience building AI products or integrating AI into an application
* Experience with some big data tech
* Experience working at an early-stage SaaS startup before
* Experience working closely with customers in a technical context

### Compensation

Salary: $170k â€“ $190k   
Equity: 0.25% â€“ 0.75%  
(depending on experience and location)

### Benefits

* Flexible working hours and location (US-based)

* Health, dental, and vision coverage

* Generous vacation policy â€“ take time when you need it

* As an early engineer, youâ€™ll have a direct path to shaping technical direction, mentoring, and leadership as the team scales.

* Direct customer exposure and high impact on product direction

### Interview Process

We aim to be efficient and transparent with our interview process. 

You will be Kaavio full-time employee number 4\. During our interview process, we want to spend 10 \- 20 hours working together. This lets us get to know each other by working on actual projects together. Weâ€™ll pay you for your time. 

This might involve us getting a coworking space together for a day and shipping a feature (weâ€™ll fly to you, or we can fly you to us). Or we can work together remotely for a couple half-days. 

We understand finding time for this can be tough with a full-time job and life. Let us know how to make this work best for you â€“ we can be flexible. 

Our process:

1. Intro call â€“ 30 min with one of the founders. The goal is to understand your motivations to join Kaavio and answer questions about us.

2. Technical conversation â€“ meet with an engineer on our team to talk through a past project and do a short systems/design exercise, no live coding.

3. Work with us â€“ join us for some real work. Youâ€™ll join our (few) meetings, work on actual projects with us, and ship code. We pay you for your time. 

4. Final conversation â€“ weâ€™ll answer any remaining questions.

5. Offer â€“ ðŸŽ‰

*If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you â€“ we're happy to accommodate\!*
